            <h2>Floods</h2>
            <p>
            Floods are one of the most common and devastating natural disasters in India. They occur mainly during the monsoon season due to heavy rainfall, overflowing rivers, dam breaches, or poor drainage systems.

Impacts of Floods in India:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loss of Life and Property:</strong>Floods often lead to the death of people and livestock, and cause widespread destruction of homes, infrastructure, and crops.</li>

<li><strong>Agricultural Damage:</strong> Flooding damages standing crops, soil quality, and irrigation systems, leading to food shortages and loss of livelihood for farmers.</li>

<li><strong>Health Hazards: </strong>Stagnant water becomes a breeding ground for diseases such as cholera, malaria, and dengue. Contaminated water supplies worsen the situation.</li>

<li><strong>Displacement: </strong>Thousands of people are forced to leave their homes, leading to overcrowding in relief camps and increased vulnerability.</li>

<li><strong>Economic Disruption: </strong>Transportation, communication, and power supply are often disrupted, affecting trade, industry, and daily life.</li>

<li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Floods erode fertile soil, destroy forests, and harm aquatic life due to water pollution and debris.</li>
</ul>

            <h2>Heatwave</h2>
<p>Heatwaves are prolonged periods of extreme heat, often accompanied by high humidity. In recent years, India has experienced increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, especially in the northern, central, and western regions.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Health Risks:</strong> Heatwaves cause heat exhaustion, dehydration, heatstroke, and worsen existing health conditions. The elderly, children, and outdoor workers are most vulnerable.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Increased Mortality:</strong> Extreme heat leads to thousands of deaths annually, particularly in areas lacking adequate shelter or cooling facilities.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Water Shortages:</strong> High temperatures increase evaporation and reduce water availability, stressing both urban and rural water supplies.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Agricultural Losses:</strong> Heatwaves damage crops, reduce yields, and affect soil moisture, putting stress on food production and farmer incomes.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Energy Demand Surge:</strong> Use of air conditioners and coolers spikes, putting pressure on power grids and sometimes causing outages.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Urban Heat Island Effect:</strong> Cities become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas due to concrete structures and limited green cover.</li>
</ul>
